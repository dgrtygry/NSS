What is NSS?

A simple programming language that anyone can learn but is very high level. Takes a couple weeks to learn but tries to be "As simple as possible".

NSS stands for "Neat. Simple. Secure".

If you want to compile, Just open nss_compiler.py to begin compiling!

NSS can deal with any form of code. Examples include "OS development", "Application development", "GUI development" and many other forms of development. NSS tries to keep everything simple and shortned to ensure the best coding experience possible.

NSS is high-level but is designed to be easy to learn and use.

I hope everyone enjoys NSS and happy coding!
